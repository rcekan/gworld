// Note: Not entirely sure this object is still needed. 
// At one point, we were have trouble passing ownership of environs to the library, 
// And the trait allowed us to create our own copy in World::new()

Currently seems a little cumbersome. However, I think it makes sense for the world to keep it's own copy of an environment object. The alternative would be to pass the environment as a reference into all the world functions, like new and run, etc, and the user would retain full control of the environs object.
