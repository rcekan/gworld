# Chromosomes

Match them. 

For breeding purposes.

For instance, 

"Hey you, I got good results myself (good enough to reproduce, on avg)
 with a few similar chromosome to you. We should reproduce." 

If the other accepts, (lol, acceptance could be a genetic variable where some breeds are more specific in their requirements. )
(or rather more likely for now, they will automatically mate if they're in the breeding pool together. 

Perhaps the criteria could be less stringent the fewer organisms in the breeding pool. 


## matching strategies

### Group the outputs
Seems like the most obvious way to do things. 
But not straightforward how one would mix/match the genes together. 
Would need to work on this. It just doesn't seem obvious if gains would be worth our time spent. 


## hidden nuron inter-dependence? 

So, within a chromosome, there's the possibility that one chromosome's hidden neurons could be mapped independently from other chromosome's hidden neurons. 
Reason: Perhaps this would yield less "cross-over noise" when using chromosal breeding techniques. 

It seems interesting, but it seems like it might introduce some constraints that slow evolution. 
Then again, the whole point would be for it to add evolution, and help chromosomes play a larger role in mating and performance.
