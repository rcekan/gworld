These docs generally document some concept for further reading. 

They're considered important for one reason or another.

Either they 

 - detail why something was done. (ie expunge.txt)
 - how an item is intended to work. (ie chromos.txt)

The files are to be updated and maintained.
Once the information expressed within no longer applies, and/or has been cannonized elsewhere in the design, then let's delete it please. 

If the information doesn't fall into one of these categories. It doesn't belong in this folder. 
This isn't some breeding ground for half-baked ideas. :D
Make another folder for that.
