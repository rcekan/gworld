# Multiple fit functions

Consider N fit functions. 
An n-dimensional vector to qualify fitness.
Breeding occurs along each axis of fitness. 

So if you're exceptional at one fitness, but not the others, it more than makes up for it. 

Ultimately, would be interesting to see if genomes with a similar fitness makeup, also share any chromosomal similarities. 

If so, we could weight their common similarities, to try to identify which chromosomes are successful for that fitness category. 


Ultimately, I feel like we'd want larger chromosomes. Like much longer. 
The ability for them to grow and enhance, over time.
