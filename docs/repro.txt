		// Or perhaps they become "fertile". 
		// And then we look for fertile partners. 
		// So during it's during test_fitness, which turns on their fertility? 
		// In this way, if something is picked twice, then I suppose it's fertility score goes up?
		// And then when it finds a chance to reproduce, 
		// It does so at the next opportunity. 
		// But perhaps it should wait for a compatible partner? 
		// Ugh, am I overthinking this? Does any body care? 
		// Okay, we pick the winners, and now they need to reproduce. 
		// Maybe people want to change the way winners are picked. There could be a default method. 
		// Or the user could provide their own. Why not?
