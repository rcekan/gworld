Library usage: 

It's like, I want to get output at any time. 

When is the best time to get output? 

How can we make the library to facilitate this ergonomically?

I think there should somehow be a "best performance list". 

And in that list, we could do a few things. 
It's almost like there need to be some deliverable. Right?
Isn't that what we usually care about? 

Some kind of deliverable? 
It just seems there are so many genetic algorithms one could think of. 
How to
 a) Try to account for a variety (all????) of them
 b) And/or, how to make the library adaptable, so people can make it do what they need. 

I think it all comes down to the "live" function. 
Along with "step"
